## Overview

This Power BI dashboard provides insights into the performance of a supply chain, with a focus on delivery times, profitability, and sales across different regions and customer segments. The dashboard is split into two pages: **Delivery Performance** and **Sales Performance**.

### Key Visuals:

1. **Delivery Status by Order Count**:
   - Visualizes the proportion of late deliveries, on-time shipments, advance shipping, and cancellations.
   - **Key Insight**: 55% of deliveries are late, signaling potential inefficiencies in the fulfillment process.

2. **Top Regions with Sales Losses**:
   - Highlights the regions with the highest sales losses due to cancellations, delays, and on-hold orders.
   - **Key Insight**: **Western Europe** and **Central America** show the highest losses.

3. **Shipping Mode vs. Delivery Status**:
   - Compares shipping methods (First Class, Standard, etc.) with their respective delivery outcomes.
   - **Key Insight**: **First Class** has more frequent late deliveries, while **Same Day** shipping performs better in delivering on time.

4. **Order Profits vs. Fulfillment Time**:
   - Displays the relationship between order-to-ship times and profitability.
   - **Key Insight**: Shorter fulfillment times tend to result in higher profits, while long delays reduce profitability.

5. **Average Days for Shipping by Status**:
   - Compares scheduled shipping days, actual shipping days, and fulfillment time for different delivery statuses.
   - **Key Insight**: **Late deliveries** are associated with longer fulfillment times, as expected.

2. **Profits by Market and Department**:
   - Breaks down profits by region and department (e.g., Apparel, Fitness).
   - **Key Insight**: **LATAM** and **Europe** generate the most profit, with Apparel and Fan Shop departments leading.

3. **Sales by Payment Type and Late Delivery Risk**:
   - Shows the correlation between payment methods and delivery performance.
   - **Key Insight**: **Debit** payments experience the highest rate of late deliveries.
